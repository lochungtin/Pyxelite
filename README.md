# Pyxelite

Pyxelite is an open source mobile ARGB controller written in React Native for web server based ARGB microcontrollers.

The app will be released onto the playstore in the new future.

An desktop version of this application is also under development.

<br />

# Micro Controller

The microcontroller used in this project is an ESP32, but any other device that supports web server hosting would be suitable for this application. The repo and code for the microcontroller can be found here.

# Building From Source

Building from source has only been tested on android devices, but theoretically it should be also available on iOS as react native supports both operating systems.

1. git clone the repo
    - ```git clone https://github.com/lochungtin/Pyxelite.git```
2. cd into the repo
    - ```cd /path/to/repo/Pyxelite```
3. install all required dependencies (setup react native if not already done so)
    - ```npm install```
4. build the app and run on device
    - ```npx react-native run-android```
