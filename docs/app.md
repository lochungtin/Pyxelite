## About

|||

|:--:|:--|
|![img](./img/settings.jpg ":size=70%")|There are currently 4 supported animations in the app and the MCU, they are: **Static (default)**, **Breathe**, **Wave**, and **Travel**|

### Custom Brightness and Motion Speed

Animation speed and brightness can be configured to the user's liking, the scale is from **0 to 255**, for both speed and brightness.

### Custom Colours and Colour Library

Colours can be created using the **colour creation tool** and saved to a locally maintained **colour library**, where colours can be selected and sent to the MCU.

## Limitations and Future Work

Currently, only one colour is support for the entire system. Upcoming versions of the project is to allow **different colours and configurations** for every single ARGB device connected.
